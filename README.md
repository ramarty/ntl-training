# Nighttime Lights for Economic Analysis

## Background

This material was developed by the [ieConnect](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/impactevaluation/partnerships/ieconnect) team as an introduction to using nighttime lights for economic analysis, with a focus on transportation applications.

## Course description

Nighttime lights have become a widely used proxy for local economic activity in the social science literature. [Henderson, Storeygard, and Weil's](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.102.2.994) seminal 2012 paper illustrated the use of leveraging nighttime lights to measure growth. Their paper helped launch the use of nighttime lights in a variety of applications; a Google scholar search of ["nighttime lights economics"](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C9&q=nighttime+lights+economics&btnG=) brings over 40,000 responses. During this time, the quality of nighttime lights data has improved and algorithms to process data have also improved. Despite improvements, using nighttime lights requires key considerations of data quality---such as cloud cover masking lights.

This course provides an overview of using nighttime lights data. It covers the different sources of nighttime lights, how to query and aggregate data, and different applications of using the data.

## Prerequisites

The course assumes familiarity with R or Python. For an introduction to these programming languages, see the DIME Analytics [R training](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-r-training) and the DIME Analytics and DECID [Python training](https://github.com/worldbank/dec-python-course).
